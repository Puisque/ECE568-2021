Part 2: Write a DNS proxy that sits between dig and local DNS server
For this part, a middle sitting in between proxy was created. It simply acting as 
A transmitter for the packages that are returned and the DNS client requests. 
Packages in return will always be forwarded to where the query is sending from.

Part 3: Spoof DNS reply using the DNS proxy
This time, the proxy will still forward the client's queries but when it gets returned
Packages it will make modification and make fake packages to forward to where the query 
Is sending from. Specifically, an.rdata is changed to '1.2.3.4', ns.rdata is changed
To "ns.dnslabattacker.net".The response will always being discard and a forged fake
One is the one we are sending to the client.
