1. Sploit1: In this target1 the vulnerability occurred belongs
to buffer overflow. Since the target is not checking the 
boundary when copying the string. We overwrite the stack
with the shellcode and change the return address to shellcode
address. 

3. Sploit3: In this tartget3 the vulnerability occurred belongs 
to buffer overflow. Since the target3 that we are given is copying 
the string iteratively, we just need to increment the pointer to 
cover the 4 bytes that "AAAA" has been placed. Another 4 bytes 
needed to be considered for return address as in Sploit1.
