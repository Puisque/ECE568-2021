PART 1:
A fake third party HTML page was generated so that user
could be tricked and input the user name with their password,
javascript was written to retrieve this information.

PART 3:
The exploitable field is message. We can write a link of 
a fake image in HTML there and set the URL of which contains
the transfer request. After the user clicks on the message,
an automated transfer will start. (Screen=423096428)

PART 4:
The exploitable field is message. Inside message we create 
two iframes. One sets up the confirmation with Javascript 
and the other shows the transfer is completed. After the 
user clicks on the message, an automated transfer will start.

PART 5:
By observation, the URL of the transfer request contains a 
field called "token" and the value of which is embedded in
its HTML code. As a result, we can create an iframe and a 
Javascript function to load the token value. They will be
filled into the exploitable field, message. After the user
clicks on the message, an automated transfer will start.

PART 6:
The vulnerability is that the target does not check if users'
input contains SQL code fragments. Therefore by injecting
"OR '1'='1", which will always be evaluated to true, we can
easily login to Neville's account even if we don't know the password.

PART 7:
The vulnerability is the same as the previous problem. By injecting
a new SQL command, we can modify Larry's salary and insert a database
trigger once we know the column names of the target form.

PART 8:
We use "101 and ((select pin from credit where cc_number='1234123412341234')>a)"
and "101 and ((select pin from credit where cc_number='1234123412341234')<b)"
where a=0, b=10000 initially. Range of the PIN is reduced when the
system's output is "Invalid account number". Finally the PIN 4862 was confirmed
when "101 and ((select pin from credit where cc_number='1234123412341234')=4862)"
was evaluated to true.
